# Face Mask Detector

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://github.com/varun0603/yolo-facemaskDetection/blob/master/YoloFaceMaskDetector.ipynb)

* Implemented You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm in tensorflow 2.0
* Used Darknet yolo weights trained on COCO dataset which has 80 classes
* Implemented Transfer learning on FaceMask dataset to detect persons with masks in a live video stream
